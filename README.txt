Memory Game

----DESCRIPTION----

This program implements the memory card game on a java swing interface.
The goal is to match every pair of cards (buttons) on the screen in as
few guesses as possible.

Once you run the program, click start to begin the game. Begin making guesses
and trying to make matches. The smiley face card is a wildcard and is not counted
in the same and is simply there to make the rows and columns even. The game keeps
track of your matches and your wrong guesses. Once you win the game a pop up window
appears to tell the user so. The restart button lets the you restart the game at any point.
